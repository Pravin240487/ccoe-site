# Terms of Service for AWS COE Consulting Engagements

## Types of Engagement

The AWS COE offers two categories of engament:

* Best Practice / POC / General Guidance
* Hands on Implementation

## Cost

Best Practice services are available to product teams under Provider Analytics for no extra cost. 

Implementation work for funded project's (teams with Capital Budgets for their work) should be funded by the project's budget, meaning AWS COE would need the Planview / PPM Optics billing information and our team member would bill time towards that budget. 

## Acceptance of new projects

Due to the size of the AWS COE team, existing roadmap items and the multiple product teams that we serve, there is a possibility that the CCOE team may not have the bandwidth to take on the consulting engagement.

Projects are generally prioritized by impact on the business, which includes the "reusability" of the work being done. Solving a problem that many teams _will_ encounter (even if only one team has) would have additional prioritization value over work that is specific to one product.

### Project End Date

All Consulting engagements will end on the date when the deliverables specified in the SOW are completed or on the project end date mentioned in the SOW, whichever comes first.
