CCOE Terraform Modules are Cloud Playbooks that enable a Cloud Practitioner to write Terraform code to deplpy AWS Resources/Services. Here is the information that is expected in each playbook:

* Instructions on how to use the module through sample profiles
* Instructions on how to contribute to the module
* How to get support for the module
* Architecture diagram 
* Test suite
* Sample use cases
* Which teams are using the module

## How to contribute a Terraform module

* To contribute an "official" module, connect with the AWS COE team ([OA_Cloud_Support@ds.uhc.com](mailto:OA_Cloud_Support@ds.uhc.com)) so we can work with you to incorporate your module. 

* To contribute a "community" module, open a PR on the [Community modules page](https://github.optum.com/oaccoe/CCOE-Site/blob/master/docs/modules/community.md)!
