1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive guide for setting up a tunnel connection between your on-premises network and a virtual private cloud (VPC) using Amazon Web Services (AWS). The tunnel is designed to ensure secure and reliable data transfer.

2. Prerequisites

Before beginning the configuration, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

Access to the firewall's public IP address provided by the On-Prem Network Engineer.

Necessary permissions and access to the AWS Console.

3. Configuration Steps

a. Firewall Public IP

Contact the On-Prem Network Engineer to obtain the firewall's public IP address that will be used for the VPN connection.

b. Create Custom Gateway

Log in to the AWS Console:

Navigate to AWS Console.

Create a Customer Gateway:

Navigate to the VPC Dashboard.

Select "Customer Gateways" from the left-hand menu.

Click "Create Customer Gateway."

Fill in the following details:

Name: GURUGRAM-MERAKI-VPN

Public IP Address: [Firewall Public IP]

Routing Options: Static

Tunnel Inside IP Version: IPv4

Leave other options as default.

Click "Create Customer Gateway."

c. Site-to-Site VPN Connection

Create a Site-to-Site VPN Connection:

Navigate to the VPC Dashboard.

Select "Site-to-Site VPN Connections" from the left-hand menu.

Click "Create VPN Connection."

Fill in the following details:

Name: GURUGRAM-MERAKI-VPN

Target Gateway Type: Transit Gateway

Select your Transit Gateway: tgw-0ddee6a6f9b353034 (attached to your VPC)

Customer Gateway ID: [Customer Gateway ID]

Routing Options: Static

Tunnel Inside IP Version: IPv4

Leave other options as default.

Click "Create VPN Connection."

d. Transit Gateway Route Table

Create a Transit Gateway Route Table:

Navigate to the VPC Dashboard.

Select "Transit Gateway Route Tables" from the left-hand menu.

Click "Create Transit Gateway Route Table."

Fill in the following details:

Name: GURUGRAM-MERAKI-VPN-ROUTE

Transit Gateway ID: tgw-0ddee6a6f9b353034

Click "Create Transit Gateway Route Table."

e. Association and Propagation

Configure Association and Propagation:

After creating the route table, go to the "Associations" tab.

Choose an association and select the Site-to-Site VPN connection (vpn-023dfbe165d969ab6) you created.

Next, under "Propagations," select the VPC (vpc-05d817c62d191c775) where you need to establish connectivity.

f. VPN Configuration File

Share the VPN Configuration File:

Share the VPN configuration file with the On-Prem Network Engineer.

To download the configuration file:

Go to the Site-to-Site VPN connection (GURUGRAM-MERAKI-VPN).

Select "Download Configuration."

Specify the manufacturer of the customer gateway device (e.g., Cisco Systems, Inc - Cisco Meraki).

g. Route Configuration

Configure Routing:

Navigate to the VPC Dashboard.

Select "Transit Gateway Route Tables" from the left-hand menu.

Locate the Transit Gateway Route Table associated with your VPC (e.g., stax-973bfd5b-9a0c-4ae8-ad46-494e25a38ac1-Development).

Under "Routes," click "Create Route."

Fill in the following details:

Destination CIDR: 172.25.22.9/32 (On-prem SQL Server IP)

Type: Active

Attachment: Choose the Site-to-Site VPN (vpn-023dfbe165d969ab6) created for the Gurugram Tunnel.

Click "Create Route."
