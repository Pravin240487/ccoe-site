## eGRC Risk Records

### Overview

eGRC Risk Records allow for projects to temporarily be out of compliance with Optum EIS policies. 

While a Risk Record can (in theory) be granted for anything, the closer you are to compliance the better your odds of having it granted. The eGRC team will require sign off from EIS and from your VP. (And possibly additional levels as well depending on the risk.)

### Step by step configuration

1. Document what resources are non compliant with policies. You can find the list of policies and resources in Cloud Board https://commercialcloud.optum.com/cloudboard/dashboard. If you need a risk record for something not triggering a Cloud Board violation, make sure you've have a statement from EIS articulating the risk. 
2. Document your compensating controls (aka mitigations) and your plan for remediating the risk (risk cannot be "ongoing" but must have a target date for resolution, maximum of 1 year).
3. Navigate to https://egrc.uhg.com/apps/ArcherApp/Home.aspx
4. Click "EIS Risk Review Form"
5. Click "Open New Record"
6. Complete the form to open the record. 

For eGRC assistance with this reach out to:
  * Pao Vang (pao.vang@optum.com) <= Main Contact (send him an email when you open a new request)

Keep in mind, eGRC Risk Records will need GL32+ approval. Make sure you've socialized your plans with your leadership before submitting the Risk Record.
