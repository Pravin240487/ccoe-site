If you ever need the Root account owner to take an action in you AWS account (most likely - you accidentally locked yourself out of an S3 bucket and need Root to fix it) you need to engage the Health Care Cloud (HCC) team. They hold Root access to all Optum AWS accounts. 

To do that:

Open a ticket by following the instructions [here](https://cloud.optum.com/docs/operational-guides/support#operational-support). If you don't get a response on your ticket follow up with the HCC team via their DL (Public_Cloud_TechOps_DL@ds.uhc.com).

If you still aren't getting a response reach out Cloud Ops (OA_Cloud_Support@ds.uhc.com).
