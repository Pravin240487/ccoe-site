# AWS Arena - Home of the AWS Center of Excellence (AWS COE)

The AWS Center of Excellence is not "a team" but a community - a community of AWS cloud practioners in the Provider organization. 

This site is an "inner source" knowledge sharing platform. Anyone is welcome to contribute here.

Likewise, the AWS COE welcomes new modules and documentation from the community and suggestions for what areas we contribute to to deliver the most value for your teams and projects.
